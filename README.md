# Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in financial bank transactions by combining rule-based approaches and advanced clustering techniques. The primary objective is to strengthen financial security by identifying unusual transaction patterns that may indicate fraudulent activities or irregularities. This initiative is part of a broader effort to apply machine learning and data mining techniques to safeguard financial systems.

# Key Components
<br>
1.Data Description

Source: Financial transaction datasets stored in parquet format.
Data Structure: The data includes the following key columns:

<ul> <li><b>CUST_CUSTNO</b>: Unique customer identifier.</li> <li><b>ACC_BUSINESSTYPE</b>: Type of business (e.g., individual, enterprise).</li> <li><b>ACC_ACCNO</b>: Account number associated with the transaction.</li> <li><b>AMOUNT</b> and <b>AMOUNTORIG</b>: Transaction amounts in different currencies.</li> <li><b>VALUEDATE</b>: Date the transaction was recorded.</li> <li><b>CONTRA_ACCNO</b>: Contra account number involved in the transaction.</li> <li>Additional transaction-specific details such as <b>BRANCH_OFFICE</b>, <b>REASON1</b>, etc.</li> </ul> <br>

2. Rule-Based Anomaly Detection
Objective: Implement predefined rules provided by the bank to identify suspicious transactions and anomalies, such as customers making frequent high-value transactions within short time frames.<br>
# Key Rule Example: A rule targeting customers who made equal deposits and withdrawals on the same day, with amounts exceeding a specified threshold, which could indicate irregular business practices.

<br>

3. FP-Growth Analysis
Objective: Apply the FP-Growth algorithm to mine frequent patterns and discover association rules within the transaction data.
Approach: Group customers by CUST_CUSTNO and analyze transaction amounts to differentiate between normal and anomalous patterns. Metrics such as lift and conviction are used to evaluate the significance of these rules.

<br>

4. Clustering-Based Anomaly Detection
Objective: Utilize multilevel clustering to detect anomalies that may not be captured by rule-based methods.
Approach:

<ul> <li>Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN) to group transactions based on similarity across various features (amounts, dates, and customer profiles).</li> <li>Compare clustering results with the anomalies identified through rule-based methods.</li> <li>Visualize clusters and anomalies using **color-coded graphs** and **plots** for better interpretation and communication.</li> </ul> <br>

5. Summaries and Reporting
Regular Updates: Periodic reports on findings from both rule-based and clustering methods, including key insights and visualizations. <br>
Interaction with Stakeholders: Continuous collaboration with the bank to verify findings, adjust detection rules, and ensure the accuracy of anomaly detection.
<br>

6. Tools and Technologies
   
Data Processing: Utilized Python, Pandas, and Dask for scalable and efficient processing of large financial datasets, ensuring seamless handling of millions of rows. <br>
Pattern Mining: Implemented FP-Growth for mining frequent transaction patterns and generating association rules to uncover significant correlations in the data. <br>
Anomaly Detection: Applied custom filtering methods to flag anomalous behavior such as deposits greater than 6,000,000 VND and withdrawals â‰¥95% of the deposited amount. <br>
Clustering: Leveraged Scikit-learn for multilevel clustering techniques, identifying and visualizing potential anomalies. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for representing clusters and distributions graphically. <br>
Deep Learning: Integrated VAE-Transformer (Variational Autoencoder + Transformer), a hybrid Deep Learning model, for advanced anomaly detection in financial transactions. This approach combines the strength of VAE in dimensionality reduction and feature learning with Transformers for sequential anomaly detection. <br>
Data Storage: Employed Google Drive for managing and storing large parquet files, ensuring easy access and processing within a distributed environment. <br>
